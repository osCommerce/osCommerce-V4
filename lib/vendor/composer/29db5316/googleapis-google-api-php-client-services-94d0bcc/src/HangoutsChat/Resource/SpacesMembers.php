   * return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at
   * most 100 memberships are returned. The maximum value is 1,000. If you use a
   * value more than 1,000, it's automatically changed to 1,000. Negative values
   * return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Optional. A page token, received from a previous
   * call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent
   * page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call
   * that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other
   * parameters might lead to unexpected results.
   * @opt_param bool showGroups Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships
   * associated with a Google Group, in addition to other types of memberships. If
   * a filter is set, Google Group memberships that don't match the filter
   * criteria aren't returned.
   * @opt_param bool showInvited Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships
   * associated with invited members, in addition to other types of memberships.
   * If a filter is set, invited memberships that don't match the filter criteria
   * aren't returned. Currently requires [user
